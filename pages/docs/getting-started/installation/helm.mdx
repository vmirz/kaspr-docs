# Install with Helm

Use helm to install and manage `kaspr-operator` and related CRDs in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.16+
- Helm 3.x

## Installation Modes

The Kaspr Operator can be installed in either cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped mode.
* When installed in cluster-scoped mode, the operator will watch for Kaspr resources across all namespaces.
* When installed in namespace-scoped mode, the operator will only watch for Kaspr resources in the same namespace where the operator is installed.

By default, the operator is installed in cluster-scoped mode. To install the operator in namespace-scoped mode, set the `watchAnyNamespace` option to `false`.

Depending on which mode is used, either the `ClusterRole` or `Role` and `ClusterRoleBinding` or `RoleBinding` resources are created respectively.

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
### Download the helm chart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/totalwinelabs/kaspr-helm.git
cd kaspr-helm
```
 
### Install the operator
 
The general syntax for helm installation is: 
```bash
helm install <release> <chart> --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace [--set <other_parameters>]
```

The variables specified in the command are as follows:

* `<chart>` A path to a packaged chart, a path to an unpacked chart directory or a URL.
* `<release>` A name to identify and manage the Helm chart once installed.
* `<namespace>` The namespace in which the chart is to be installed.
* Default configuration values can be changed using one or more `--set <parameter>=<value>` arguments. Alternatively, you can specify several parameters in a custom values file using the --values `<file>` argument.


```bash
helm install kaspr-operator charts/operator \
    --set operator.watchAnyNamespace=true \
    -n kaspr-operator \
    --create-namespace
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This will install the operator in a dedicated `kaspr-operator` namespace using default options 
which is sufficient for most deployments. However, you can override options to customize the 
deployment according to your needs. See [values.yaml](https://github.com/TotalWineLabs/kaspr-helm/blob/master/charts/operator/values.yaml) 
for all possible configuration options.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

CRDs are included in the operator helm chart and will be automatically installed with the operator.
However, they need to be manually updated or removed when necessary.

* Updating CRDs
```bash
kubectl apply -f ./charts/operator/crds
```

* Deleting CRDs
```bash
kubectl delete -f ./charts/operator/crds
```

## Uninstall the Operator

```bash
helm uninstall kaspr-operator -n kaspr-operator
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Helm will not delete Kaspr CRDs. You will need to manually delete these if necessary.
