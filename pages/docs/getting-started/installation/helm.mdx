# Install with Helm

Use helm to install and manage `kaspr-operator` and related CRDs in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.16+
- Helm 3.x

## Operator Installation Modes

The Kaspr Operator can be installed in either cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped mode.
* When installed in cluster-scoped mode, the operator will watch for Kaspr resources across all namespaces.
* When installed in namespace-scoped mode, the operator will only watch for Kaspr resources in the same namespace where the operator is installed.

By default, the operator is installed in cluster-scoped mode. To install the operator in namespace-scoped mode, set the `watchAnyNamespace` option to `false`.

Depending on which mode is used, either the `ClusterRole` or `Role` and `ClusterRoleBinding` or `RoleBinding` resources are created respectively.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Download the helm chart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/totalwinelabs/kaspr-helm.git
cd kaspr-helm
```
 
### Install the operator
 
```bash
helm install kaspr-operator charts/operator \
    -n kaspr-operator \
    --create-namespace
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This will install the operator in a dedicated `kaspr-operator` namespace using default options 
which is sufficient for most deployments. However, you can override options to customize the 
deployment according to your needs. See [values.yaml](https://github.com/TotalWineLabs/kaspr-helm/blob/master/charts/operator/values.yaml) 
for all possible configuration options.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

CRDs are included in the operator helm chart and are automatically installed when installing the operator. 
However, they need to be manually updated or removed when necessary.

* Updating CRDs
```bash
kubectl apply -f ./charts/operator/crds
```

* Deleting CRDs
```bash
kubectl delete -f ./charts/operator/crds
```

## Uninstall the Operator

```bash
helm uninstall kaspr-operator -n kaspr-operator
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Helm will not delete Kaspr CRDs. You will need to manually delete these if necessary.
