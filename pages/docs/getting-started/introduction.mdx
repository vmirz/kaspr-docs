# Introduction

## How it works

### Agents

Process infinite streams in a straightforward manner. The concept of “agents” comes from the actor model, and means the stream processor can execute concurrently on on hundreds of machines at the same time.

Deploy an agent using a Kubernetes resource and assign it to an app. Use regular Python or your favorite python libraries to customize stream processing logic and behavior.

```yaml filename="agent.yaml"
apiVersion: kaspr.io/v1alpha1
kind: KasprAgent
metadata:
  name: my-agent
  labels:
    kaspr.io/app: my-app
spec:
    input:
        topic: my-topic
    processor:
        pipeline:
            - my-processor
        operations:
            - name: my-processor
              map:
                python: |
                    def process(event):
                    return event
```
