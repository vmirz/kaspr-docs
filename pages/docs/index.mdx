# Kaspr Documentation
 
Kaspr dramatically simplifies the creation of real-time, event-driven applications and microservices. Built as a set of Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), it provides a straightforward framework for building scalable streaming and event processing systems.

Kaspr has a single dependency: Kafka, which serves as the transport layer for all events processed within the system. While similar to [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/39/documentation/streams/), Kaspr offers greater flexibility by not being limited to a domain-specific language (DSL). Kaspr is optimized for Kubernetes, offering both ease of use and scalability.

## Use Cases

- Event driven microservices
- Real-time data integration
- Real-time analytics
- Stateful computations
- Materialized views/cache
