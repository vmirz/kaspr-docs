# Introduction

## How it works

### Agents

Process infinite streams in a straightforward manner. The concept of “agents” comes from the actor model, and means the stream processor can execute concurrently on on hundreds of machines at the same time.

Deploy an agent using a Kubernetes resource and assign it to an app. Use regular Python to customize how a stream is processed streams and use your favorite python libraries.

```yaml filename="agent.yaml"
apiVersion: kaspr.io/v1alpha1
kind: KasprAgent
metadata:
  name: my-agent
  labels:
    kaspr.io/app: my-app
spec:
    input:
        topic: my-topic
    processor:
        pipeline:
            - my-processor
        operations:
            - name: my-processor
              map:
                python: |
                    def process(event):
                    return event
```
