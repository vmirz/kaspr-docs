# Kaspr Documentation
 
Kaspr seeks to dramatically simplify and ease the process of building real-time event-driven applications and microservices. Kaspr is implemented as Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definition) with native support for running arbitrary code for processing logic.

Kaspr has only one dependency: Kafka. Kafka serves as the transport for all events processed by Kaspr. 
Kaspr is most comparable to [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/39/documentation/streams/), but it doesn't constrain you to a DSL (Domain Specific Language). Kaspr is designed for Kubernetes, flexiblity and ease of use.

## Use Cases

- Event driven microservices
- Real-time data integration
- Real-time analytics
- Stateful computations
- Materialized views/cache
